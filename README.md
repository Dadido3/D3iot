# D3iot

A software package to handle IoT devices.

Right now this repository doesn't contain much that can run on its own.
There are several sub-packages you still might be interested in:

- [github.com/Dadido3/D3iot/light/wiz/](light/wiz/): Everything you need to communicate with WiZ light devices. Also contains tools to debug or profile these devices.
- [github.com/Dadido3/D3iot/light/emission/](light/emission/): A library that contains color space math stuff for anything that emits light.
